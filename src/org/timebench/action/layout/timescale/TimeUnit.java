/**
 * <p>
 * An TimeUnit represents a unit of time like Milliseconds, 50 Milliseconds,
 * Days, Weeks etc.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An TimeUnit is associated with a {@link BasicTimeScale} to represent it's
 * current accuracy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An TimeUnit essentially consists of
 * <li>a name like "Month", "Quarter" or "50 Milliseconds"</li>
 * <li>a couple of {@link DateFormat}s which should be used to format
 * {@link Date}s at this TimeUnit.
 * <ul>
 * For example at TimeUnit "Days" a {@link DateFormat} should not include
 * anything below the accuracy of days such as hours or minutes, because it
 * would not make sense to display this highly inaccurate data. Another aspect
 * is that for example the provided short {@link DateFormat} should not include
 * years as this would make the the output too long. The long {@link DateFormat}
 * on the other hand should include years but not milliseconds or seconds, but
 * it should include hours to allow a little interpolation of dates.
 * </ul>
 * <ul>
 * Which {@link DateFormat}s to provide is not straightforward and must be
 * chosen carefully depending on the context of it's use.
 * {@link TimeUnitProvider} provides a set of predefined TimeUnits for the
 * {@link AdvancedTimeScale} class.
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li> The maximum length of the TimeUnit in milliseconds. </li>
